  - text: "Just pick a goal, a goal you truly want to achieve, and take a clear-eyed look at your weaknesses -- not so you'll feel less confident, but so you can determine exactly what you need to work on.

As you gain skill, you'll also gain a feeling of genuine confidence, one that can never be taken away--because you've earned it."
  - text: "Don't wait until everything is just right. It will never be perfect. There will always be challenges, obstacles, and less than perfect conditions. So what? Get started now.
